# MUSAIK

### Vision
The Musaik team has a vision of making connection through music a much easier process. We want our users to view our app as a hub for finding and connecting with others that share the same musical taste. 

### Description
New music discovery is a souless, intensive experience. If you want to find new artists, you'll have to sift through playlist on top of playlist for hours. Musaik will connect users through streaming parties and auto-match chats. Users will discover new music easily and enjoyably.

### Deployment
~~Our app is now running at https://www.musaik.ml.~~ (deprecated from 01/2023)
- CI & CD is also implemented using GitHub Actions.

### How to Run
How to run our app on your computer.
1. Download npm if it hasn't been installed.
```
# check if npm is already installed
npm -v

# if not, install npm on your computer
npm install -g npm
```
2. Install all the requirements.
```
# root directory
npm install 

# front-end

```
3. Create a build file at ```/front-end```.
